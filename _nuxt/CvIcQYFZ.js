Unbeknown to me at the time, I was given the grand title of the “Victory Baby of Herbert Road.” Having been born on the east side of the River Medway, I was able to call myself “A Man of Kent.” As I grew up, I eventually came to realize that there was also a far less flattering title for me—a “sinner.”"),e("p",null,"I did not get off to a good start in life as my mother died when I was four years old. I resented the fact my stepmother was introduced to me as “This is your new Mum!” The tension between us grew worse the older I became. In a defiant act of rebellion against parental discipline, I left the family home in a furious rage when I was sixteen. While I was able to live with my elder brother for a short time, his circumstances meant I was made homeless.

Such was my working environment that I was an underage drinker and gambler who carried a six-inch sheath knife for personal protection. When the chance to move away from the Medway Towns came, in the form of a job at the White Horse Inn, near Hertford, I took it. I felt the need to run for my life as a result of my disgraceful lifestyle."),e("p",null,"My grossly immoral conduct and rudeness soon got me into more trouble. I was dismissed from my job in the hotel and struggled to find alternative employment. Eventually, I was employed as a Store Porter in Hertford County Hospital. In the amazing goodness of God, I was working with the Hospital Storekeeper, Mr Gartry, who was a Christian. He told me of his personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and called upon me to repent of my sin and seek God’s forgiveness.

Jumping in the local River Lee, in the hope that the water was deep enough for a non-swimmer to drown in, came to mind.

The teachers, who had faithfully taught what the Bible says, had spoken about the prospects of going either to heaven or hell when we die. I knew I was certainly not worthy of heaven but I could not be certain that my soul would not end up in hell.

He preached from John’s Gospel chapter four and the more he said about the immoral woman of Samaria, who Christ met at a well, the more I sensed my need to trust in Christ.
